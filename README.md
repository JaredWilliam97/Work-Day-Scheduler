I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used HTML, CSS, and jQuery to complete this calender. 

As I built my website I used comments to help others reading to be able to understand it better.

This was a great project. I have learned alot from jQuery and excited to learn more
